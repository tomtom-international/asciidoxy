= Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/[Keep a Changelog],
and this project adheres to https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html[Semantic Versioning].


== Unreleased

=== Changed

  - Complete redesign of the type parser. The type parser is now token based instead of using
    regular expressions.
  - The new type parser is more strict and will issue warnings when a type is considered malformed.
    These warnings will not trigger an error when `--warnings-are-errors` is enabled.
  - Improve formatting of method parameters. Each parameter is put on its own line. The first
    parameter is put on a separate line if the definition gets too long.

=== Fixed

  - Issue #9 - std::function types with function arguments are now fully parsed.
  - Many parsing issues for types have been addressed in the new type parser.


== 0.5.5 (8 Jun 2020)

=== Fixed

  - Support for HTML/markdown tables in description parser.


== 0.5.4 (21 May 2020)

=== Changed

  - Additional arguments for `api.include` and `api.insert` are passed as attributes of the
    `include` directive.
  - Improved performance in resolving references and looking up elements to link to and insert.

=== Fixed

  - Matching elements in the same namespace are now preferred over elements in a different
    namespace. Only if all matches are in a parent namespace, the match will be ambiguous.
  - For types directly included in a namespace the include file is now present.
  - C++ functions that are inserted directly, so not as part of an enclosing type, have a section
    header and include file.
  - Nested python type hints are now detected and shown in the documentation.


== 0.5.3 (16 May 2020)

=== Added

  - Allow filtering what members, enum values, inner classes, and exceptions get included when
      using api.insert().
  - Show progress bars for long running tasks.
  - Support for documenting python code with the help of doxypypy.
  - Specify a required version of AsciiDoxy in the adoc files.

=== Changed

  - Default log level decreased to warnings.


== 0.5.2 (24 Apr 2020)

=== Added

  - Support for free functions in C++


== 0.5.1 (22 Apr 2020)

=== Added

  - Added option multi\_page\_link to include() method, so an included adoc file is generated but
    not linked to in multi-page mode.


== 0.5.0 (21 Apr 2020)

=== Added

  - When api.insert or api.link is ambiguous, all matching candidates are shown.

=== Changed

  - Links that are part of an inserted element are also considered when looking for dangling links.

=== Fixed

  - Report full error information when collection fails.


== 0.4.3 (2 Apr 2020)

=== Fixed

* Nested enums are no longer ignored in Java.
* Fix enum template for Java. Descriptions are now complete and in the right column.


== 0.4.2 (30 Mar 2020)

=== Fixed

* Ignore friend declarations for C{plus}{plus}.
* Improve handling of Java generics.
* Improve type handling for Objective C.


== 0.4.1 (27 Mar 2020)

=== Added

* Disambiguate function overloads (and other callables) based on the types of the parameters.

=== Changed

* Search by name with an originating namespace now also finds partial namespace overlaps.
* Correctly take the originating namespace into account when resolving type references.

== 0.4.0 (19 Mar 2020)

* New collect module. Uses a package specification file to get Doxygen XML files and other include
  files from both remote (HTTP) locations and the local file system.
* Support for generating PDF files.

=== Changed

* Option `-a linkcss` is no longer provided to AsciiDoctor by default. You need to add it to the
  command line invocation of AsciiDoxy if needed.
* Command line parameters are updated to use the collect module instead of Artifactory.
* AsciiDoxy is now licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.
* Code style has been updated to match PEP-008, enforced by yapf.

=== Added

* Support for Java interfaces.


== 0.2.1 (15 Jan 2020)

=== Added

* Argument `--force-language` to force the language used for reading Doxygen XML files. This is

=== Changed

* Try to use the detailed description if there is no brief description.


=== Fixed

* Debug output is now valid, indented, JSON.
* Objective C types with a space are now correctly detected.

* Remove spurious spaces in method argument list when the argument has no name.


== 0.2.0 (23 Dec 2019)

=== Changed

* Short names are now default, use `full_name` to get the fully qualified name again.
* Parameters for `link`, `insert`, `link_*`, and `insert_*` have changed. The language and kind are
  no longer mandatory. They will be deduced if there is only one element with the specified name.
  An error is raised if there are multiple matches. Only `name` can be passed as positional
  argument now.
