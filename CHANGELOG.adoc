All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/[Keep a Changelog],
and this project adheres to https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html[Semantic Versioning].


== Unreleased

=== Removed

  * The `api.` prefix for commands is no longer supported.
  * Old style packages without `contents.toml` are no longer supported. The `xml_subdir` and
    `include_subdir` entries in the package specification file are now ignored.


== 0.8.5 (25 Feb 2022)

=== Fixed

  * Escape links in descriptions containing double underscores to prevent triggering a known
    AsciiDoctor bug.
  * In descriptions text after an unsupported or unknown XML tag was missing.
  * Exceptions raised from AsciiDoc files were not handled correctly and raised another exception
    instead of showing a human friendly trace back.


== 0.8.4 (12 Jan 2022)

=== Fixed

  * The wheel distribution was missing required CSS files.


== 0.8.3 (12 Jan 2022)

=== Added

  * {Cpp}: Support template parameter descriptions for functions/methods and classes.


=== Changed

  * AsciiDoxy now uses its own stylesheets for added functionality like multipage TOC and multipage
    navigation. These stylesheets are extensions of the default AsciiDoctor stylesheet. They can 
    still be overridden from the command line.
  * The multipage navigation bar now floats at the bottom of the screen filling the full width of
    the document body.
  * Including a document multiple times or both including and embedding the same document is now a
    warning or error.


=== Fixed

  * Spaces in `insert` and `link` commands are ignored.
  * Array types (like `Type[]`) are properly supported for {Cpp}, Java and Objective C.
  * Use CSS directly to update margins to accommodate the multipage toc. No more JavaScript causing
    jumping pages.


== 0.8.2 (30 Dec 2021)

=== Fixed

  * The required version for `importlib_resources` was too strict, causing installation issues.


== 0.8.1 (29 Dec 2021)


=== Added

  * Running AsciiDoctor automatically is now optional. By using `--backend adoc` the generated
    AsciiDoc files are exported to the output directory, instead of the output of AsciiDoctor. This 
    allows direct use of the AsciiDoc by other tools. The generated AsciiDoc is now optimized for 
    this use case by not having any absolute paths, temporary files, and fragment files.
  * *Experimental.* Replace the builtin templates for generating API reference with your own
    customized versions. Provide a directory that overrides the builtin templates and allow 
    specifying a different template to use in the `insert` command.
  * For increased performence in subsequent runs, generated python code for templates and input
    documents is cached in the build directory. Use command line argument `--cache-dir` to set a 
    different location for the cache.
  * Command-line arguments are exposed inside AsciiDoc files through the `config` object .


=== Changed

  * Embedded files, inserted with `include` and `always_embed=True`, are no longer using temporary
    files.
  * Linking to an embedded file from outside the file where it is embedded is now possible iff the
    file is embedded only once. If the file is embedded multiple times it can only be linked from 
    those files that embed it.
  * Minimum supported python version is now 3.7. Python 3.6 is end of life.
  * The Ruby interpreter is now started only once to process all generated AsciiDoc files. This
    significantly decreases the time required to process a large number of pages in multipage mode.
  * Unknown arguments are no longer passed through to AsciiDoctor. Commonly used arguments are
    explicitly supported by AsciiDoxy now. If you need to pass additional arguments, use the `adoc` 
    backend to generate the AsciiDoc files and manually run AsciiDoctor on the output.


=== Fixed

  * Removed unneccessary pass for partial matches when resolving references. Resolving references
    is now almost instantaneous (on large code bases). The old pass was mostly finding incorrect 
    matches.


== 0.8.0 (29 Oct 2021)

=== Added

  * Completely rewritten description parser for Doxygen. It supports more kinds of tags and inserts
    much less whitespace in the resulting AsciiDoc. It more closely follows the way Doxygen intends
    to format the descriptions.
  ** Support `dot` and `plantuml` diagrams in Doxygen descriptions. They require
     AsciiDoctor-Diagram to be rendered. In the Doxyfile the option `PLANTUML_JAR_PATH` is 
     required, even though Doxygen is not really rendering the plantuml diagrams. Without the 
     option, plantuml diagrams are ignored by Doxygen.
  ** Verbatim text in Doxygen descriptions is supported.
  ** Support special Doxygen paragraphs that are similar to AsciiDoc admonitions: `\attention`,
     `\note`, `\remark`, and `\warning`.
  ** Support special Doxygen paragraphs that contain metadata: `\author`, `\bug`, `\copyright`,
     `\date`, `\deprecated`, `\since`, and `\todo`. They are added to the overview table of 
     class-like elements, or the parameter table of functions/methods.
  ** Complex tables with cells spanning multiple columns and/or rows and nested tables (1 level)
     are now supported.
  ** Support explicit line breaks in paragraphs.
  ** Support LatexMath formulae in Doxygen descriptions. It is required to enable `:stem:` in the
     AsciiDoc header to render the formulae.
  ** Support images in Doxygen descriptions. Only `html` type images are shown, also for PDF
     output. Make sure to include all images in the package containing the xml and specify the 
     `asciidoc.image_dir` option in `contents.toml`.
  ** Support MarkDown (preprocessed by Doxygen) in Doxygen descriptions. This adds support for:
     headers, strikethrough, numbered and nested lists, horizontal rulers, and block quotes.
  ** Support special characters. This includes 250 characters that Doxygen represents with a
     separate XML tag.
  ** Support HTML headings, preformatted text and other HTML specific styles.
  ** Support custom anchors.
  ** Support parameter descriptions consisting of multiple paragraphs.
  ** Respect output type specific content. Only content for XML and HTML output is used.
  ** Support Unicode emoji.


=== Changed

  * Code blocks in descriptions try to respect the language specified in the original code. This
    includes "unparsed" code blocks. Only if no language is specified, the language of the 
    described element is used.


=== Fixed

  * Spaces in code blocks, present as `<sp />`, are no longer ignored.
  * Actually create links to known exceptions from method/function documentation.
  * #37: When type names contain nested types, and the nested types have namespaces, the short name
    was incorrectly generated, resulting in incorrect section titles.
  * #35: {Cpp}: Support typedefs for function types. Limitation: documentation for the function
    parameters is missing. A planned refactoring will fix this.
  * #31: Pipe symbols in documentation no longer cause tables to become malformed.


== 0.7.5 (20 Aug 2021)

=== Added

  - Provide detailed stack traces for links to missing elements. It should now be clear what
    commands are causing the links to be inserted, especially when links are inserted as part of
    another element's API reference.
  - Provide detailed stack traces when inserting the same element multiple times. It should now be
    clear whether the element was inserted as part of another element.
  - Support preconditions and postconditions for functions and methods.


=== Changed

  - Provide clearer errors and trace backs for exceptions while parsing AsciiDoc and for internal
    errors.
  - No longer use fragment files to include generated API reference. Instead, the generated
    AsciiDoc is directly embedded in the processed AsciiDoc file.
  - Extra AsciiDoc attributes are no longer supported for the `insert` command.


=== Fixed

  - Do not generate empty "Members" section if there are no visible members.
  - Fix running AsciiDoctor on Windows. Thank you r0ckarong!


== 0.7.4 (25 Mar 2021)

=== Added

  - Flexible anchors: With multi-page documents it can be hard to keep cross document references
    working, especially when moving them between files. Using the new `anchor` command you can
    create a flexible anchor that will be resolved by AsciiDoxy. Use `cross_document_ref` with only
    an `anchor` to refer to flexible anchors.


=== Fixed

  - Remove invalid downloaded packages from the cache. This solves an issue where a failed download
    was never retried and required a manual purge of the build directory.
  - Verify the contents of downloaded packages with `contents.toml`. Delete invalid packages from
    the cache.
  - Copying image files to an existing output directory no longer results in a file collision
    error. File collision errors now contain more details about the packages causing the collision
    and also report about files in the output directory that are not part of any package.
  - Provide correct image directory to AsciiDoctor.


== 0.7.3 (25 Feb 2021)

=== Fixed

  - Objective C: Remove debug artefacts. This was causing layout problems in enclosed types.


== 0.7.2 (24 Feb 2021)

=== Fixed

  - Bring back character escaping in links.
  - Improve character escaping in source blocks.
  - [AD-56] Objective C: Fix visibility of enclosed types to match the enclosing type. Objects
    exposed in a header file are always accessible.


== 0.7.1 (13 Feb 2021)

=== Added

  - [AD-59] Support for variables that are shared between included documents.

=== Changed

  - Collisions between files in packages are now warnings by default. Use `--warnings-are-errors`
    to change them back to errors. Collisions between files and directories are still fatal errors.

=== Fixed

  - #27: `xml_subdir` and `include_subdir` should not be mandatory in the package specification if
    packages with `contents.toml` are used.
  - #28: {Cpp}: support `constexpr` functions and constructors.
  - Changes to the insertion filter in included documents will no longer affect parent documents.
  - Objective C: Do not append enclosing type to full name of nested types.
  - Improve escaping of names in links.


== 0.7.0 (31 Dec 2020)

=== Added

  - Infrastructure for transcoding documentation from one to another language.
  - Swift: [AD-28] Generating Swift documentation based on Objective C source code.
  - Kotlin: [AD-27] Generating Kotlin documentation based on Java source code.
  - [AD-15] Allow forcing to embed an included file in multipage mode.
  - [AD-37] Show members for other visibility levels than public. By default only public and
    protected members are shown. Use `filter` to change.
  - [AD-32] New package format with contents metadata file. The contents file specifies whether the
    package contains AsciiDoc includes or reference, and in what subdirectory. It can now also
    include images that need to be included to the output.
  - [AD-32] A directory containing images to include can be specified using `--image-dir`.
  - [AD-11] The usage documentation has been separated into a getting started guide and reference
    documentation.

=== Changed

  - Argument `leveloffset` in `include` now supports `None` to prevent adding `leveloffset` in
    the generated AsciiDoc.
  - [AD-32] By default the directory containing the input file is not copied to the intermediate
    build directory. Use `--base-dir` to enable copying of additional include files.
  - [AD-32] `cross_document_ref` and `include` support a new `package_name` keyword to
    point to files in packages. For new packages with a contents metadata file this keyword is
    mandatory. If the package specifies a root document, the `filename` is optional now.
  - [AD-32] For `cross_document_ref` the `anchor` and `link_text` arguments are now keyword
    only. For backwards compatibility `api.cross_document_ref` is still supports the old syntax.
  - [AD-32] For `include` the `leveloffset`, `link_text`, and `link_prefix` arguments are now
    keyword only. For bacwards compatibility `api.include` still supports the old syntax.
  - [AD-32] Multiple packages supplying the same file is now an error.
  - [AD-54] If no `anchor` or `link_text` is given, the title of the document is used for the link
    created by `cross_document_ref`. If the title cannot be read, the file name stem is used.
  - [AD-54] If no `link_text` is given, the title of the document is used for the link created by
    `include` in multipage mode. If the title cannot be read, the file name stem is used.
  - [AD-42] The `api.` prefix for commands is no longer needed. It will be deprecated in a future
    version. The `api.link_<kind>` and `api.insert_<kind>` commands are also deprecated and not
    available without the `api.` prefix.

=== Fixed

  - [AD-35] Improve handling of complex closures.
  - Objective C: Support `__autoreleasing` suffix.
  - Including files in parent directories no longer raises an exception.
  - Files and directories provided on the command-line are validated before use.
  - [AD-55] Insert anchors at the top of includes in singlepage mode to make cross document
    references without anchors work.


== 0.6.3 (1 Nov 2020)

=== Fixed

  - [AD-33] Actually allow filtering of inner classes by visibility.
  - [AD-46] Always fall back to original name if type parsing fails.
  - [AD-48] Java: Support unmangled annotations.


== 0.6.2 (22 Sep 2020)

=== Added

  - {Cpp}: [AD-10] Support const methods.
  - {Cpp}: Show destructors and operators for classes.
  - [AD-8] Support default values for parameters.

=== Fixed

  - {Cpp}: [AD-34] Hide default and deleted members.
  - Correctly detect include file for free functions.
  - [AD-33] Inner types can now be filtered by visibility (only public and protected for now).


== 0.6.1 (27 Jul 2020)

=== Added

  - [AD-18] Basic support for Java type annotations.
  - Extend 'file_names' option for .toml files to support 'version' and 'name' interpolation.

=== Fixed

  - Java constants are now described correctly.


== 0.6.0 (26 Jun 2020)

=== Added

  - [AD-4] Multi-page Table of Contents.

=== Changed

  - [AD-1] Complete redesign of the type parser. The type parser is now token based instead of
    using regular expressions.
  - [AD-1] The new type parser is more strict and will issue warnings when a type is considered
    malformed.  These warnings will not trigger an error when `--warnings-are-errors` is enabled.
  - [AD-2] Improve formatting of method parameters. Each parameter is put on its own line. The
    first parameter is put on a separate line if the definition gets too long.
  - [AD-3] Loading API reference using a package spec is no longer required. The `--spec-file`
    option is no longer mandatory. This way you can generate any AsciiDoc file with python code,
    without generating API reference documentation.
  - [AD-5] When using `api.link` the first match from an overload set is returned, instead of
    throwing an error. This can be disabled by using `allow_overloads=False`. `api.insert` still
    requires a perfect match.
  - [AD-29] Rename `multi_page` and `multi-page` to `multipage`. This is a breaking change for the
    command-line options and `api.include`.

=== Fixed

  - Issue #9 - std::function types with function arguments are now fully parsed.
  - [AD-1] Many parsing issues for types have been addressed in the new type parser.


== 0.5.5 (8 Jun 2020)

=== Fixed

  - Support for HTML/markdown tables in description parser.


== 0.5.4 (21 May 2020)

=== Changed

  - Additional arguments for `api.include` and `api.insert` are passed as attributes of the
    `include` directive.
  - Improved performance in resolving references and looking up elements to link to and insert.

=== Fixed

  - Matching elements in the same namespace are now preferred over elements in a different
    namespace. Only if all matches are in a parent namespace, the match will be ambiguous.
  - For types directly included in a namespace the include file is now present.
  - C++ functions that are inserted directly, so not as part of an enclosing type, have a section
    header and include file.
  - Nested python type hints are now detected and shown in the documentation.


== 0.5.3 (16 May 2020)

=== Added

  - Allow filtering what members, enum values, inner classes, and exceptions get included when
      using api.insert().
  - Show progress bars for long running tasks.
  - Support for documenting python code with the help of doxypypy.
  - Specify a required version of AsciiDoxy in the adoc files.

=== Added

  - Support for free functions in C++


== 0.5.1 (22 Apr 2020)

=== Added

  - Added option multi\_page\_link to include() method, so an included adoc file is generated but
    not linked to in multi-page mode.


== 0.5.0 (21 Apr 2020)

=== Added

  - When api.insert or api.link is ambiguous, all matching candidates are shown.

=== Changed

  - Links that are part of an inserted element are also considered when looking for dangling links.

=== Fixed

  - Report full error information when collection fails.


== 0.4.3 (2 Apr 2020)

* New collect module. Uses a package specification file to get Doxygen XML files and other include
  files from both remote (HTTP) locations and the local file system.
* Support for generating PDF files.

=== Changed

* Option `-a linkcss` is no longer provided to AsciiDoctor by default. You need to add it to the
  command line invocation of AsciiDoxy if needed.
* Command line parameters are updated to use the collect module instead of Artifactory.
* AsciiDoxy is now licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.
* Code style has been updated to match PEP-008, enforced by yapf.

=== Added

* Support for Java interfaces.


== 0.2.1 (15 Jan 2020)

=== Changed

* Short names are now default, use `full_name` to get the fully qualified name again.
* Parameters for `link`, `insert`, `link_*`, and `insert_*` have changed. The language and kind are
  no longer mandatory. They will be deduced if there is only one element with the specified name.
  An error is raised if there are multiple matches. Only `name` can be passed as positional
  argument now.

=== Fixed

* Remove surrounding whitespace for types and parameters. This caused incorrect rendering of
  monospace text.
* C{plus}{plus}: Include enclosed structs.
