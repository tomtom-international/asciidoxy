== Package format

AsciiDoxy supports 2 physical package formats:

* A directory on the local file system, or a mounted remote file system.
* A tar.gz archive hosted on an HTTP server.

Other archive formats and compressions are not supported at the moment.

== Package specification files

AsciiDoxy needs to know where to find the XML files containing the API reference documentation. It
supports loading these files from a local directory or from a remote HTTP server. Package
specification files describe where to collect the XML files.

A single location containing the XML files is called a package. The idea is that each package
corresponds to an isolated component that can be included as a separate package. Documentation for
separate packages can refer to each other when used in combination.

Packages can contain additional resources like images, example source code, and AsciiDoc files.
These resources can be referred to from the input AsciiDoc files.

Package specification files use https://github.com/toml-lang/toml[TOML] format. They can contain the
following sections:

`packages`:: Specification of packages to include.
`sources`:: Templates for similar packages.

=== Packages

The `packages` section is the only mandatory section. It contains a separate subsection for each
package to include. The name of the subsection is the name of the package:

[source,toml]
----
[packages]

[packages.package1]
# Specification of `package1`

[packages.package2]
# Specification of `package2`
----

A package has a specific type and based on the type different key/value pairs are required. For all
types of packages the following key/value pairs are required:

`type`:: The type of the package.

Packages of type `local` refer to a local directory. They require the following additional 
key/value pairs:

`package_dir`:: Absolute or relative path to the directory containing the package.

Example:

[source,toml]
----
[packages.local_package]
type = "local"
package_dir = "/path/to/my/package/"
----

Packages of type `http` are downloaded from a remote location. They can consist of multiple files,
all of which need to be (compressed) tarballs. Each file can contain XML files, include files, or
both.

The following additional key/value pairs are required:

`url_template`:: Template for constructing the URL to download the package file from.
`file_names`:: List of file names making up the package.

The following additional key/value pairs are optional:

`version`:: Version number of the package.
`login`:: User name to login to the HTTP server.
`password`:: Password to login to the HTTP server.
`login_env`:: Environment variable containing the user name to login to the HTTP server.
`password_env`:: Environment variable containing the password to login to the HTTP server.

The `url_template` can contain the following placeholders, that are replaced when creating the URL
to download each package file:

`{name}`:: Replaced with the name of the package.
`{version}`:: Replaced with the version of the package.
`{file_name}`:: Replaced with the file name.

When one or more of `login`, `password`, `login_env`, or `password_env` is provided, they are used 
to authenticate to the HTTP server. `login` and `password` contain the authentication details in 
plain text in the specification file. It is not recommended to use `password`.

`login_env` and `password_env` contain the name of an environment variable providing the value for 
respectively `login` and `password`. They overrule `login` and `password`. If the environment 
variable is not set, an error will be given. It is possible to combine `login` with `password_env` 
and `login_env` with `password`.

If none of `login`, `password`, `login_env`, or `password_env` are given, the system netrc file is 
inspected to find authentication settings for the host name.

Example:

[source,toml]
----
[packages]

[packages.package1]
type = "http"
url_template = "https://example.com/{name}/{version}/{file_name}"
version = "12.3.4"
login = "asciidoxy"
password_env = "ASCIIDOXY_PASSWORD"
----

If no `version` is specified for the package, the version is retrieved from a version file. The
version file is a comma separated values file containing pairs of package names and corresponding
versions. It can contain any number of fields, but it is required to have a header containing the
names `Component name` and `Version` for the columns containing these.

Example:

----
Component name, Version
package1,3.0.0
package2,4.5.1
----

=== Sources

The `sources` section allows specifying templates for packages. Each template can specify a common
"source" of packages. With a source, settings that are duplicated for many packages can be specified
only once.

A source section can contain every key/value pair that is allowed for a package. Packages can
specify the source they are based on by using the `source` key/value pair.

When a source is used, the key/value pairs of the source and the package are merged. Values for keys
that are present in both the package and the source will be taken from the package. So the package
values override source values.

Example:

[source,toml]
----
[sources]

[sources.remote_server]
type = "http"
url_template = "https://example.com/{name}/{version}/{file_name}"

[packages]

[packages.package1]
source = "remote_server"
version = "12.3.4"
----

== Package content files

Each package should describe its contents in a metadata file called `contents.toml`. This file is
used by AsciiDoxy to determine how to use the contents of the package.

Package specification files use https://github.com/toml-lang/toml[TOML] format. They can contain the
following sections:

`package`:: Metadata for the package.
`reference`:: The API reference information contained in the package.
`asciidoc`:: AsciiDoc and other files to be included in AsciiDoc generation.
`python`:: Python scripts to include in AsciiDoc generation.

=== Package section

The `package` section contains general metadata for the package. This section is mandatory for all
packages. It contains the following key/value pairs:

`name`:: Name of the package. This overrides the name specified in the package specification file.

=== Reference section

The `reference` section describes the API reference contained in the package. It is only required if
the package contains API reference information. Without this section, API reference information is
ignored. It contains the following key/value pairs:

`type`:: The type of API reference information. Currently, only supports `doxygen` for Doxygen XML
format.
`dir`:: Subdirectory inside the package containing the API reference information files.

=== Asciidoc section

The `asciidoc` section describes AsciiDoc and other files in the package that can be included in the
generated documentation. This section is only required if the package contains files to be included.
It can contain the following key/value pairs:

`src_dir`:: (Required) Subdirectory inside the package containing the AsciiDoc and other include
files.
`image_dir`:: (Optional) Subdirectory inside the package containing images to be included in the
AsciiDoc files. These files are copied to the image directory used for all AsciiDoc files.
`root_doc`:: (Optional) Document to include by default for the package. Used if not specific file
in the package is mentioned.

=== Python section

The `python` section describes files in the package that are to be included when generating the 
AsciiDoc files. The subdirectory containing the python files is automatically added to the python 
path for all files.

`dir`:: (Required) Subdirectory inside the package containing python code to be included in 
generation.
